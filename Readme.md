- What do you see from the above image?
    - we have the price in the A column,
    - B column consists of 5 day moving average,i.e 5 day Moving Average means taking average over past 5 days values, where 10 day moving average means its the average over past 10 days.
    - From the image we can observe that the moving average(MA) for first 4 days is empty, as we need 5 days data to calculate 5 day MA, and 10 days data for a 10 day MA

- For the purpose of this assignment, we will be using 20 Day and 50 Day moving averages.
    - Now that we know about the concept of Moving average, we shall be wondering how to use it to determine whether to buy or sell a stock.
